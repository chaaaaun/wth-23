**Ah Boy** is an innovative speech-to-text chatbot designed to be the ultimate digital sidekick for the seniors in Singapore.
In a rapidly advancing digital world, bridging the generation gap between technology and seniors has never been more crucial.
Just like a caring grandchild, Ah Boy is here to lend a patient and understanding hand to seniors
as they navigate the complexities of modern technology.

## Features

### Dialect Support
Majority of the seniors in Singapore are more versed in dialects such as Hokkien. Our chatbot allows for dialect voice inputs, making it incredibly intuitive and accessible for seniors.

### Speech-to-text
Our chatbot allows input directly through speech, greatly reducing the need for seniors to type lengthy and complex words.

### Simplified Instructions
Complex tech jargon is transformed into simple, clear instructions that empower seniors to understand technology with ease.

### 24/7 Accessibility
Unlike seniors' grandchildren who are constantly busy, our chatbot is available around the clock, providing instant assistance whenever seniors need it, regardless of time zones.
